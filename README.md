# Simple mechanism rules the dynamics of volleyball

The python program gui4_en.py is a visualization program that allows extracting information from video records of volleyball games.  
The program is designed for a trained operator to record the most relevant events observed during rallies. 
The information gathered at each event include,
1.  An identification number for the player that hit the ball in the event.
2.  The time of the event referred to the beginning of the game.
3.  The position of the player that hit the ball.  In two dimensions, referred to the court’sfloor.
4.  The type of hit performed:  pass, set, attack, block, etc

The file events_all.dat contains the collected information from 3302 rallies.
